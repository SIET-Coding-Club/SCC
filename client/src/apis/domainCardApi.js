      "Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves designing the user interface, writing code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and setting up server infrastructure. Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with, while back-end development handles the behind-the-scenes functionality. Full-stack developers work on both. Web development encompasses a wide range of technologies and frameworks and requires expertise in areas like responsive design, database management, and security. It's essential for businesses and individuals to establish an online presence, share information, and provide interactive services on the internet.",
